# WifoStore Food Shopping App

## Overview

WifoStore is a food shopping app created to streamline the grocery shopping experience for busy individuals. It offers a user-friendly interface to manage grocery purchases efficiently, even during hectic schedules. By leveraging modern web technologies, WifoStore provides a fast, responsive solution for all grocery needs.

This project was built through a collaborative effort of frontend and backend engineers, successfully integrating various technologies to create a full-stack application.
