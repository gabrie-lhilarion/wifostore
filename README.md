WifoStore Food Shopping App
Overview
WifoStore is a food shopping app designed to simplify the lives of busy individuals by offering a streamlined solution for purchasing food items during hectic workdays. By leveraging modern web technologies, we aim to provide a user-friendly experience for individuals looking to manage their grocery needs quickly and efficiently.

This project was the result of a collaborative effort between frontend and backend engineers, where we successfully integrated a range of technologies to build both the frontend and backend of the application.

Features
Frontend: Built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and HTML for a responsive, modern user interface.
Backend: Powered by PostgreSQL for the database and APIs for data retrieval and interaction.
Deployment: Hosted and deployed using Render, providing a scalable and reliable solution for our backend API.
Technology Stack
Frontend:
React
Vite
Tailwind CSS
HTML
Backend:
PostgreSQL
RESTful APIs
Deployment:
Render (for backend deployment)
Challenges and Solutions
Throughout the development process, we faced a few challenges, particularly around debugging and integrating the various technologies used. However, our persistence paid off, and we were able to deliver a fully functional app on time. Completing a JavaScript course earlier in the year was instrumental in helping to integrate React effectively into the project.

Lessons Learned
This project was an excellent opportunity to strengthen our knowledge of full-stack development and understand the complexities of working with multiple technologies. It reinforced the importance of persistence and collaboration, especially when tackling unexpected challenges during development.

Future Improvements
We plan to continue enhancing WifoStore by:

Optimizing the codebase for better performance.
Improving the user experience with further user testing.
Implementing advanced features like user accounts, product reviews, and enhanced security measures for transactions.
